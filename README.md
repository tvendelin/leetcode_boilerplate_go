# Boilerplate for Leetcode Tasks in Go

Boilerplate for solving [leetcode.com](http://leetcode.com) tasks locally in Go. Steps to take:

- to remove this `README`, the `git` repo and initialize go module and a new `git` repo, run 
```
sh setup.sh
```
- add your tests to `solution_test.go`. You might need to modify the `testcase` struct 
- append the skeleton of the function from your task to `solution.go`
- run `go test`
- copy-and-paste your solution on [leetcode.com](http://leetcode.com) when done
